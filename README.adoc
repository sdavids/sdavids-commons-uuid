== Building from Source

All modules can be build with Gradle using the following command:

 $ ./gradlew clean assemble

All modules can be tested with Gradle using the following command:

 $ ./gradlew clean test

Since Gradle has excellent incremental build support, one can usually omit executing the clean task.

To stop the Gradle daemon execute:

 $ ./gradlew --stop

== Installing in Local Maven Repository

All modules can be installed in a local Maven repository via the following command:

 $ ./gradlew clean install
